There are 3 programs in this repository ; The first is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The second is a program that takes as input the speed of a car for instance 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “OK”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. The third is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
